<h2>The Story</h2>
<p><strong>$119.99</strong>, <strong>$84.99</strong>, &quot;$100 off promotion&quot;... the price of these corner accent lamps are wayyyy to high. Especially considering the cost of injection molded plastic and LEDs, the markup &amp; margin on these things have to be in the 70% or greater region. After getting served many, <em>many</em> <a href="https://instagram.com/hhheath_">Instagram</a> Ads, I decided that I would take matters into my own hands and design my own.</p>
<p>Seeing as I've recently acquired a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon, I've been itching for a project that put 3D printing at the center. I've also recently moved to the Chicago area and the new place has a lot of space that I need to do <em>something</em> with. I've also just been in the making mood recently as I've been starting to follow along more with the maker community (much more than I already have). It was just a perfect storm of me seeing an opportunity to make something myself that had use and was challenging.</p>
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>There are probably two processes here:</p>
<ol>
<li>From idea to model</li>
<li>model to real thing</li>
</ol>
<p>The first being the process of getting the idea of the thing into my computer with the help of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and the second being the process of going from CAD file to <strong>real thing</strong>.</p>
<h3>From Idea to Model</h3>
<p>In the past few years I've taught myself how to use parametric CAD software to help me get my ideas for physical solutions to problems out of my head and into a 3D model so I can see things from all angles. It's powerful to be able to visulize an idea that you have in your head in 3D space.</p>
<h4>Sofware: Fusion360</h4>
<p>Fusion360 is currently my CAD software of choice right now. It's simple to use, has a nice UI, it's free*, and it runs well on my machine. I say it's &quot;free*&quot; because you can only have up to 10 files declared as &quot;editable&quot; at a time, and Autodesk also requires you have a connection to their &quot;cloud&quot; to do specific things. It's a great piece of software in my opinion, it just kind of sucks to have to use a closed source piece of software like this.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Just like any good engineer knows, you have to set bounds and rules to the project. Not everyone has the unlimited budget of a DoD contractor!</p>
<ol>
<li>all structural parts need to be 3d printable</li>
<li>it can stand on it's own</li>
<li>the power cable can run through one of the legs</li>
<li>the LED strip is easily attached and can easily be sourced</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I started there, and ended up here:</p>
<img src="/imgs/ambilamp-cad-full.png" width="100%" />
<p>What you're looking at here is the full model of the AmbiLamp! It's broken into 12 different parts; a cable leg with a hole down the middle (2), a non-cable leg (2), a base (1), and seven (7) vertical pieces to get it to stand 60 inches.</p>
<p>Let's chat about each section, briefly. If you don't care about <em>how</em> this was designed, then you can move ahead to the second part, Model to Real Thing.</p>
