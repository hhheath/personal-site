<p>Let's make something for 100 days straight.</p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p>There are a lot of times that I start something without a clear definition of what I'm doing. Let's do that here...</p>
<p><strong>What is Make100?</strong></p>
<p>Make100 is similar to #100DaysofCode or #100Daysof<insert-topic-here> (actually it's exactly like those), but with the focus on <strong>generally making anything.</strong> I want to commit, wholly, to creating <em>something</em> every day for the next 100 days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Code? Absolutely.
Painting? Yep.
Food? Count it.
3D Printing? No doubt.
Sweat? Work it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just <strong>make</strong> something. Once a day. For 100 days.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Well... there are dozens of reasons why I want to do this, but, the main reason is that <strong>I want to exercise my creative muscle.</strong> Along with that, I want to commit to something. <strong>Consistency</strong> was my 2022 word of the year, and I want to stay true to that.</p>
<p>I want to challenge myself to commit to something and to remain consistent throughout. I just want to make <em>things</em>; Software, small electronics projects, more 3D printing, maybe try spray paint art; the possibilities are endless. I just want to <em>create</em>.</p>
<p>I also think that movements like #100DaysofCode might end up being too niche for some. Even though they would like to commit to doing <em>something</em> for 100 days in a row, or want to participate in a community like that, #100DaysofCode might be too technical or too focused.</p>
<p>This is for <strong>all makers.</strong></p>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>I started on May 1, 2022 (2022-05-01) with the revamp of this website, which you can learn more in <a href="/posts/hello/">this post</a>. Today, it's this blog post (and some delicious pasta I had for dinner). I'm not sure what it's going to be tomorrow, but that is a part of the excitement, right?</p>
<p>This means that my last day of make will be August 9, 2022 (2022-08-09).</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>I'll <a href="https://twitter.com/hhheath_">tweet</a> something every day with the hashtag #Make100 and a picture or a link. I'll probably set up a list on tweetdeck for the hashtag #Make100 so I can see, like, and retweet the things you make (there's probably a project idea here).</p>
<p>I'd love to start a community around this as well. So, in that regard, I've made a discord server that you <a href="https://discord.gg/ZFqfTj6NVg">can join</a> if you want to talk to Other Makers who are also participating in #Make100.</p>
