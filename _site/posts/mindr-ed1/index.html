<p><em>This the first edition of (hopefully) many as I build this app in public.</em></p>
<p>I'm a forgetful person. Maybe it's just who I am, maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD like The Algorithms think I have. Either way, I need a self-hostable way to send myself reminders on a recurring basis. Things like: Fill up water bottle, drink water, load/unload dishwasher, etc. So, let's build it for everyone to use.</p>
<p>Sure, I could get this done with just a simple simple script for each task, but what's the fun in that? I want a big project for myself, so this is it!</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>At home, my own server a set of services in docker containers behind a <a href="https://traefik.io/traefik/">Traefik</a> proxy. I host things like Nextcloud, ArchiveBox, Wallabag, etc. So, Mindr will be a docker-first, self-hostable application.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts are to use <a href="https://temporal.io">Temporal</a> as the backend for the jobs that will be created. Ideally, a user will login, and be able to create a new <strong>remindr</strong>. Each remindr will schedule a new workflow run in Temporal. Each remindr will have, at launch, 3 options for sending remindrs:</p>
<ol>
<li>SMS - through twilio.</li>
<li>Email - through sendgrid.</li>
<li>Webhook - just an HTTP request to a URL.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Thoughts of Grandeur</h2>
<p>This will, without a doubt, always be a 100% free &amp; open source project and always available for those who want to run &amp; scale their own version.</p>
<p>I also want to try to run a managed service for this, as well. I don't know how I'd do that, but it's something I'd like to do.</p>
<hr>
<p>In any case, I always want your input! Hit me up on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hheath_">Mastodon</a>. Eventually, I'll find a good place to put a repo and start working on it now.</p>
<p>Maybe <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>?</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
