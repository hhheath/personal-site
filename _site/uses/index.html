    <p><strong>Updated on:</strong> 2024-11-14</p>
<p>This is a page dedicated to the tools that I use and what I use them for. I'm very particular and do a lot of research for the things that I use every day, so if you'd like to know more or have questions, lemme know on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hheath_">mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, this isn't even the <strong>half</strong> of it... but it's been updated mostly for now. I need to really spend some time here.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<h3>Mobile/Wearable</h3>
<p>I have made the permanent switch to Android. It feels good.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro:</strong> It's just so good. Default everything. So happy to be back on Android.</li>
<li><strong>Garmin Fenix 7x Solar:</strong> My fitness is one of my <em>main</em> focuses in my life right now. This device is beefy, tech heavy, has a long lasting battery, and is just a general joy to wear.</li>
<li><strong>Whoop 4.0:</strong> See above about my fitness being at the core of my life right now. This is mostly for ✨vibes✨ currently, but it's great to have on. I think it's better at tracking sleep, honestly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compute</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main:</strong> 14-inch 2023 Macbook Pro with the M2 Pro chip. It's perfect for what I need, and will last me a long time. It's also what this website was built with (mostly).</li>
<li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Powerspec G441. 3070 Ti, i7 13700KF, 32GB DDR5-5600. It's also something I do a bit of stuff here and there with.</li>
<li><strong>VPS:</strong> I have a VPS on Digital Ocean mostly for Syncthing, but looking to increase it's usage for other things/services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The software I use is always in a state of flux, but there are always a few staples that I <em>always</em> use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> I write plain text (see <a href="https://sive.rs/plaintext">write plain text</a> by Derek Sivers). I use this as a fancy skin to my plaintext notes. It's great, but I'm not the biggest fan of it not being OSS.</li>
<li><strong>Neovim:</strong> I write about it <a href="/posts/nvim/">here</a>. I still use VS Code some, as I'm in a customer facing role, but neovim get's the lions share of the workload.</li>
<li><strong>Wezterm:</strong> I dropped alacritty because i wanted tabs and split panes <strong>alongside</strong> tmux.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last bit of software info: check out <a href="https://github.com/hhheath/dotfiles">my doftfiles</a></p>
<h2>Misc.</h2>
<p>I carry a smattering of other tech with me in my backpack, but not a lot of it is worth mentioning as it is mostly cables, dongles, and other stuff. I also am pretty particular about my peripherals at my desk and while I travel, so here they are!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anker PowerCore 2000:</strong> You can find it <a href="https://a.co/d/3jsJ0vZ">here</a> (it's not an affiliate link). It's compact enough to carry around always, small enough to still carry onto airplanes, and can quickly charge my phone and can charge up my laptop in emergency situations. It goes with me everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Caldigit TS3+ USB-C Dock:</strong> What else would I use? Caldigit is the best in the game, and this dock has been used <strong>daily</strong> for the last 3 and a half years. It's a powerhouse, and I <em>for sure</em> would not have the luxurious set up that I have now without it.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Master 3:</strong> It's not the best mouse for gaming, but it is the best mouse for literally everything else. Plus, it's USB-C charging. So, when I do travel, I still only need the one cable. A workhorse of a mouse with long lasting battery and great ergonomics.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Keys Mini:</strong> This is my main keyboard these days. I love a good mechanical keyboard (hell even split keyboards) but with the way my desk is set up, I love having the bluetooth and quick switching.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Airpods Max:</strong> While I <em>do</em> use android as my main mobile OS, my personal laptop and work laptop are Macs. So, these are great for that. They're heavy as <em>shit</em>, though.</li>
<li><strong>Wired Apple earbuds:</strong> Consistent, light, great mic. Both in 3.5mm and USB-C for phone &amp; laptop. Hard to compete with the price-to-consistency here.</li>
<li><strong>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds:</strong> For runs &amp; walks outside, and for chores around the house. I love true wireless headphones. The airpods pro are great, but they suck on android, and these are GREAT. I just wish the transparency mode was as good as Apple's.</li>
<li><strong>Samsung T5 500GB Hard Drive:</strong> Self explanatory. USB-C, works with my phone and my laptops. Small and light. Great piece.</li>
