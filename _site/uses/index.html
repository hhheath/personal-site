  <article>
    <p>This is a page dedicated to the tools that I use and what I use them for. I'm very particular and do a lot of research for the things that I use every day, so if you'd like to know more or have questions, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/hhheath_">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This is a work in progress...</strong></p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Here's all the hardware I'm working with. I use a surprising amount.</p>
<h3>Mobile/Wearable</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro:</strong> I actually switch phones pretty often. My phone is, as I'm assuming it is for most people, an extension of me. So, because of that, what phone I'm changes with how I'm feeling. I think this is my last iPhone, and I still use my Pixel 6 throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Google Pixel 6:</strong> This one is actually an interesting one. I currently run <a href="https://protonaosp.org/">ProtonAOSP</a> on it. As I mentioned above, I do end up changing phones pretty often. I end up using this phone for a lot of testing things like Open Source Android OS's, sandboxing Google Apps with <a href="https://microg.org/">MicroG</a>. There's probably a post coming up where I give my $0.02 on privacy. All to say, I switch phones a lot, so I keep this one around, charged, turned on, and within arms reach at mostly all times.</li>
<li><strong>Whoop 4.0:</strong> In my endless pursuit to lose weight and track everything about me, I wear a <a href="https://www.whoop.com/">Whoop 4.0</a>. &quot;Why not just wear an Apple Watch?&quot; you ask... well, I address that next, but it's mostly because it't compatible with both iOS and Android (see above).</li>
<li><strong>Apple Watch Series 6:</strong> Closing my rings are addicting. I like being able to delete emails from my wrist without picking up my phone. I like being able to leave my phone on silent. There are a lot of reasons to keep wearing an Apple Watch, but it's becoming increasingly more of a chore. The Whoop plus a regular watch might be the coming switch.</li>
<li>As of 2022-10-08... I still don't know if I'm going to daily carry the iPhone or the Pixel. But, I have made the decision to buy the Pixel 7 Pro once I get back from a work trip to San Francisco. I will update this page once it arrives and I make the switch. Adios, Apple. See more <a href="/src/posts/apple-vs-android/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compute</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framework Laptop:</strong> My <em>main</em> laptop. I just freaking love this thing. Their <a href="https://frame.work/about">purpose</a> is something that I really admire, support, and want to see succeed. I <strong>love</strong> the idea of not having to think about buying a <em>whole new</em> laptop if something in this one were to break or die. I really like the idea that I can just buy new RAM, or buy a bigger hard drive if things aren't performing like I need them to. The expansion cards are such a key component of this thing, too. Not having to carry around a dongle is *Chef's Kiss*.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://us.msi.com/Laptop/GS66-Stealth-10SX/Overview">MSI GS66 Stealth Pro</a>:</strong> My gaming/3D design laptop. I keep this laptop because I do spend a lot of time video gaming with friends. I also do some 3D printing &amp; 3D design, so having a Windows laptop with a dedicated GPU. There are a lot of things to like about this computer, and some things to not like. But, overall, I do like having this laptop. Though, I do see an eGPU involved in my setup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The software I use is always in a state of flux, but there are always a few staples that I <em>always</em> use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> A really, <em>really</em> good skin to plain text notes that enables me to connect notes together. I primarily write plain text (see <a href="https://sive.rs/plaintext">write plain text</a> by Derek Sivers) since I'm able to write/edit on any device using any program, but Obsidian provides a really nice skin to plain text with things like plugins and hot keys and connecint notes so that you can connect thoughts as you write. There's a lot that I could say about this software, but I think I'll leave it at: If you're looking for a note taking app that does it all, look no further than Obisidian.</li>
<li><strong>Neovim:</strong> I write about it <a href="/posts/nvim/">here</a>. I still use VS Code often, as I'm in a customer facing role, it's just easier to show people things in VS Code than it is neovim. The native support for Jupyter Notebooks is a pretty large benefit as well, as I do write &amp; run a lot of those.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Everyday Carry / Misc.</h3>
<p>I carry a smattering of other tech with me in my backpack, but not a lot of it is worth mentioning as it is mostly cables, dongles, and other stuff. I also am pretty particular about my peripherals at my desk and while I travel, so here they are!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anker PowerCore 2000:</strong> You can find it <a href="https://a.co/d/3jsJ0vZ">here</a> (it's not an affiliate link). It's compact enough to carry around always, small enough to still carry onto airplanes, and can quickly charge my phone(s) and can charge up my work laptop in emergency situations. It goes with me everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Caldigit TS3+ USB-C Dock:</strong> What else would I use? Caldigit is the best in the game, and this dock has been used <strong>daily</strong> for the last 3 and a half years. It's a powerhouse, and I <em>for sure</em> would not have the luxurious set up that I have now without it.</li>
<li><strong>ZSA Moonlander Mk1:</strong> A split, tentable keyboard that is just so fun to use. I use Kailh Box White switches that are just *Chef's Kiss*. It's fully programmable, so I've got all kinds of layers and macros that help me navigate around a screen much easier. I've got a few macros for some of the <a href="/posts/nvim/">vim</a> bindings as well as some layers and quick switches for Linux, macOS, and Windows for when I switch between my three laptops (the macbook is for work).</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Master 3:</strong> It's not the best mouse for gaming, but it is the best mouse for literally everything else. Plus, it's USB-C charging. So, when I do travel, I still only need the one cable. A workhorse of a mouse with long lasting battery and great ergonomics.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Keys Mini:</strong> When I get sick of the mechanical keyboard, or want to declutter my desk a bit (the moonlander is a bit keyboard, and since it's split it does take up more space on the desk) I switch over to this keyboard. It can switch devices with the tap of a button (just like the MX Master mouse) which is a great pairing with the Caldigit dock because then the only thing I have to change when I want to switch from work to play is the laptop, and it's all USB-C!</li>
<li><strong>Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones:</strong> These are the best wireless headphones you can buy right now that aren't a sole part of the Apple Ecosystem (AirPods Max). Active Noise Cancelling, solid battery life, automatic activity detection, transparency mode, and comfort that allows me to wear these all day. I take them everywhere, I take calls with them, I go for walks with them on, they're amazing. Probably my most single recommended piece of tech.</li>
<li><strong>AirPods Gen 3:</strong> Just the regular, non-pro, airpods gen3. Since my work laptop is a mac, the simplicity with which I can just put some small speakers in my ears and they <em>automatically</em> connect and are ready for zoom calls is just too much to pass up on. I will say, though, they don't stay in my ear worth a shit, so I tend to only use them for work calls while sitting/standing at my desk.</li>
<li><strong>Beats Fit Pro:</strong> For when I have a more-intense-than-a-walk workout or when I'm traveling ultralight and can't pack my Sony headphones. Same chip &amp; technology that's in the AirPods Pro, but with a little wingtip to keep them in your ear (a serious problem for me that the wingtip solves) <strong>and</strong> they have a physical button instead of that damn pinch/force crap on the AirPods.</li>
