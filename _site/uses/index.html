<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Here's all the hardware I'm working with. I use a surprising amount.</p>
<h3>Mobile/Wearable</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>iPhone 13 Pro:</strong> I actually switch phones pretty often. My phone is, as I'm assuming it is for most people, an extension of me. So, because of that, what phone I'm changes with how I'm feeling. I think this is my last iPhone, and I still use my Pixel 6 throughout the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whoop 4.0:</strong> In my endless pursuit to lose weight and track everything about me, I wear a <a href="https://www.whoop.com/">Whoop 4.0</a>. &quot;Why not just wear an Apple Watch?&quot; you ask... well, I address that next, but it's mostly because it't compatible with both iOS and Android (see above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 6:</strong> Closing my rings are addicting. I like being able to delete emails from my wrist without picking up my phone. I like being able to leave my phone on silent. There are a lot of reasons to keep wearing an Apple Watch, but it's becoming increasingly more of a chore. The Whoop plus a regular watch might be the coming switch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compute</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framework Laptop:</strong> My <em>main</em> laptop. I just freaking love this thing. Their <a href="https://frame.work/about">purpose</a> is something that I really admire, support, and want to see succeed. I <strong>love</strong> the idea of not having to think about buying a <em>whole new</em> laptop if something in this one were to break or die. I really like the idea that I can just buy new RAM, or buy a bigger hard drive if things aren't performing like I need them to. The expansion cards are such a key component of this thing, too. Not having to carry around a dongle is *Chef's Kiss*.</li>
