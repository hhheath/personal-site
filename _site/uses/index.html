  <article>
    <p>This is a page dedicated to the tools that I use and what I use them for. I'm very particular and do a lot of research for the things that I use every day, so if you'd like to know more or have questions, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/hhheath_">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This is a work in progress...</strong></p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Here's all the hardware I'm working with. I use a surprising amount.</p>
<h3>Mobile/Wearable</h3>
<p>I have made the <a href="/posts/apple-vs-android/">permanent switch</a> to Android. It feels good.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Pixel 7 Pro:</strong> I have retired and recycled my Pixel 6 and am running a stock Pixel 7 Pro with <a href="https://novalauncher.com/">Nova Launcher</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Garmin fenix 7x Solar:</strong> I'm in the process of losing weight and getting into shape for a triathlon. This device is beefy, tech heavy, has a long lasting battery, and is just a general joy to wear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compute</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framework Laptop:</strong> My <em>main</em> laptop. I just freaking love this thing. Their <a href="https://frame.work/about">purpose</a> is something that I really admire, support, and want to see succeed. I <strong>love</strong> the idea of not having to think about buying a <em>whole new</em> laptop if something in this one were to break or die. I really like the idea that I can just buy new RAM, or buy a bigger hard drive if things aren't performing like I need them to. The expansion cards are such a key component of this thing, too. Not having to carry around a dongle is *Chef's Kiss*.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://us.msi.com/Laptop/GS66-Stealth-10SX/Overview">MSI GS66 Stealth Pro</a>:</strong> My gaming/3D design laptop. I keep this laptop because I do spend a lot of time video gaming with friends. I also do some 3D printing &amp; 3D design, so having a Windows laptop with a dedicated GPU. There are a lot of things to like about this computer, and some things to not like. But, overall, I do like having this laptop. Though, I do see an eGPU involved in my setup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The software I use is always in a state of flux, but there are always a few staples that I <em>always</em> use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obsidian:</strong> A really, <em>really</em> good skin to plain text notes that enables me to connect notes together. I primarily write plain text (see <a href="https://sive.rs/plaintext">write plain text</a> by Derek Sivers) since I'm able to write/edit on any device using any program, but Obsidian provides a really nice skin to plain text with things like plugins and hot keys and connecint notes so that you can connect thoughts as you write. There's a lot that I could say about this software, but I think I'll leave it at: If you're looking for a note taking app that does it all, look no further than Obisidian.</li>
<li><strong>Neovim:</strong> I write about it <a href="/posts/nvim/">here</a>. I still use VS Code often, as I'm in a customer facing role, it's just easier to show people things in VS Code than it is neovim. The native support for Jupyter Notebooks is a pretty large benefit as well, as I do write &amp; run a lot of those.</li>
<li><strong>Helix:</strong> A newcomer to the group of software, but I'm trying out the Helix editor (at least on my windows machine). There's really no reason for me to be testing this out, I just like to try things out :)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Everyday Carry / Misc.</h2>
<p>I carry a smattering of other tech with me in my backpack, but not a lot of it is worth mentioning as it is mostly cables, dongles, and other stuff. I also am pretty particular about my peripherals at my desk and while I travel, so here they are!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anker PowerCore 2000:</strong> You can find it <a href="https://a.co/d/3jsJ0vZ">here</a> (it's not an affiliate link). It's compact enough to carry around always, small enough to still carry onto airplanes, and can quickly charge my phone(s) and can charge up my work laptop in emergency situations. It goes with me everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Caldigit TS3+ USB-C Dock:</strong> What else would I use? Caldigit is the best in the game, and this dock has been used <strong>daily</strong> for the last 3 and a half years. It's a powerhouse, and I <em>for sure</em> would not have the luxurious set up that I have now without it.</li>
<li><strong>ZSA Moonlander Mk1:</strong> A split, tentable keyboard that is just so fun to use. I use Kailh Box White switches that are just *Chef's Kiss*. It's fully programmable, so I've got all kinds of layers and macros that help me navigate around a screen much easier. I've got a few macros for some of the <a href="/posts/nvim/">vim</a> bindings as well as some layers and quick switches for Linux, macOS, and Windows for when I switch between my three laptops (the macbook is for work).</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Master 3:</strong> It's not the best mouse for gaming, but it is the best mouse for literally everything else. Plus, it's USB-C charging. So, when I do travel, I still only need the one cable. A workhorse of a mouse with long lasting battery and great ergonomics.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Keys Mini:</strong> When I get sick of the mechanical keyboard, or want to declutter my desk a bit (the moonlander is a bit keyboard, and since it's split it does take up more space on the desk) I switch over to this keyboard. It can switch devices with the tap of a button (just like the MX Master mouse) which is a great pairing with the Caldigit dock because then the only thing I have to change when I want to switch from work to play is the laptop, and it's all USB-C!</li>
<li><strong>Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones:</strong> These are the best wireless headphones you can buy right now that aren't a sole part of the Apple Ecosystem (AirPods Max). Active Noise Cancelling, solid battery life, automatic activity detection, transparency mode, and comfort that allows me to wear these all day. I take them everywhere, I take calls with them, I go for walks with them on, they're amazing. Probably my most single recommended piece of tech.</li>
<li><strong>Beats Fit Pro:</strong> For when I have a more-intense-than-a-walk workout or when I'm traveling ultralight and can't pack my Sony headphones. Same chip &amp; technology that's in the AirPods Pro, but with a little wingtip to keep them in your ear (a serious problem for me that the wingtip solves) <strong>and</strong> they have a physical button instead of that damn pinch/force crap on the AirPods.</li>
