<h2>What I'm up to <em>right now</em></h2>
<p>Updated on Mon May 02 2022 20:16:14 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time) from <strong>Cincinnati, OH</strong></p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Currently I'm at <a href="https://www.predicthq.com/">PredictHQ</a> working as a Customer Experience Engineer. I started here on April 18, 2022 after my time at <a href="https://www.losant.com">Losant</a>. I'm really looking forward to this new challenge, and I really believe I'll have a great impact here.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hhheath/pw4">This site</a>. I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I'm in the middle of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash">Snow Crash</a>. I'm also starting <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1303.The_48_Laws_of_Power">The 48 Laws of Power</a> and <a href="https://sive.rs/h">How to Live</a>.</p>
<h2>What else?</h2>
<p>I'm still infatuated with cooking. I'm very lucky to live within walking distace to <a href="https://www.findlaymarket.org/">Findlay Market</a> so my access to high quality, local produce and meat. I've really leveled up my cooking game recently.</p>
<p>I'm the secretary of <a href="https://www.hive13.org">Hive13</a>, a makerspace here in Cincinnati. I'm also the 3D Printing Warden. This means I take care of the area and make sure the machines are running in tip-top shape.</p>
