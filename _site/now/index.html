<h2>What I'm up to <em>right now</em></h2>
<p>Updated on <strong>2024-11-13</strong> from <strong>Chicago, IL</strong></p>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>Currently living in the Southwest Suburbs of Chicago.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Currently I'm a Senior Solutions Engineer at <a href="https://edgeimpulse.com">Edge Impulse</a> working on building solutions and helping prospects reach value in Edge AI. Previously, I was at <a href="https://www.predicthq.com/">PredictHQ</a> working as a Solutions Engineer after spending my first two years with PredictHQ as a Customer Experience Engineer. Before that, I was at <a href="https://www.losant.com">Losant</a> as a customer success engineer.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hhheath/personal-site">This site</a>. I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hheath_">My Mastodon</a>. I just want to <em>create</em> more, simply for the sake of creating.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson</li>
</ul>
<h2>What else?</h2>
<p>I'm still actively spending time focused on my athletic endurance. I have big plans for 2025 in the way of races that I want to do and where I want to take my fitness. In the past 18 months, I've lost 90lbs, and am looking to lose another 50ish before my first race in April of 2025.</p>
