This is a page dedicated to the tools that I use and what I use them for. I'm very particular and do a lot of research for the things that I use every day, so if you'd like to know more or have questions, lemme know on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@hheath_). 

Honestly, this isn't even the **half** of it... but it's been updated mostly for now. I need to really spend some time here. 

## Hardware

### Mobile/Wearable

I have made the permanent switch to Android. It feels good. 

- **Google Pixel 9 Pro:** It's just so good. Default everything. So happy to be back on Android. 
- **Garmin Fenix 7x Solar:** My fitness is one of my _main_ focuses in my life right now. This device is beefy, tech heavy, has a long lasting battery, and is just a general joy to wear. 
- **Whoop 4.0:** See above about my fitness being at the core of my life right now. This is mostly for ✨vibes✨ currently, but it's great to have on. I think it's better at tracking sleep, honestly.

### Compute

My Main laptop is a 14-inch 2023 Macbook Pro with the M2 Pro chip. It's perfect for what I need, and will last me a long time. 

## Software

The software I use is always in a state of flux, but there are always a few staples that I _always_ use. 

- **Obsidian:** A really, _really_ good skin to plain text notes that enables me to connect notes together. I primarily write plain text (see [write plain text](https://sive.rs/plaintext) by Derek Sivers) since I'm able to write/edit on any device using any program, but Obsidian provides a really nice skin to plain text with things like plugins and hot keys and connecting notes so that you can connect thoughts as you write. There's a lot that I could say about this software, but I think I'll leave it at: If you're looking for a note taking app that does it all, look no further than Obsidian. 
- **Neovim:** I write about it [here](/posts/nvim/). I still use VS Code some, as I'm in a customer facing role, but neovin get's the lions share of the workload.  
- **Wezterm:** I dropped alacritty because i wanted tabs and split panes **alongside** tmux. 

## Everyday Carry / Misc.

I carry a smattering of other tech with me in my backpack, but not a lot of it is worth mentioning as it is mostly cables, dongles, and other stuff. I also am pretty particular about my peripherals at my desk and while I travel, so here they are!

- **Anker PowerCore 2000:** You can find it [here](https://a.co/d/3jsJ0vZ) (it's not an affiliate link). It's compact enough to carry around always, small enough to still carry onto airplanes, and can quickly charge my phone(s) and can charge up my work laptop in emergency situations. It goes with me everywhere.
- **Caldigit TS3+ USB-C Dock:** What else would I use? Caldigit is the best in the game, and this dock has been used **daily** for the last 3 and a half years. It's a powerhouse, and I _for sure_ would not have the luxurious set up that I have now without it. 
- **Logitech MX Master 3:** It's not the best mouse for gaming, but it is the best mouse for literally everything else. Plus, it's USB-C charging. So, when I do travel, I still only need the one cable. A workhorse of a mouse with long lasting battery and great ergonomics. 
- **Logitech MX Keys Mini:** When I get sick of the mechanical keyboard, or want to declutter my desk a bit (the moonlander is a bit keyboard, and since it's split it does take up more space on the desk) I switch over to this keyboard. It can switch devices with the tap of a button (just like the MX Master mouse) which is a great pairing with the Caldigit dock because then the only thing I have to change when I want to switch from work to play is the laptop, and it's all USB-C!
- **Apple Airpods Max:** While I _do_ use android as my main mobile OS, my personal laptop and work laptop are Macs. So, these are great for that. They're heavy as _shit_, though.
- **Wired Apple earbuds:** I mean... consistent, easy on the ears, great mic. Both in 3.5mm and USB-C for phone & laptop. 
- **Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds:** For runs & walks outside, and for chores around the house. I love true wireless headphones. The airpods pro are great, but they suck on android, and these are GREAT. I just wish the transparency mode was as good as Apple's.
