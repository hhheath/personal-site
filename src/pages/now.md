## What I'm up to _right now_

Updated on **2024-11-13** from **Chicago, IL**

## Where 

Currently living in the Southwest Suburbs of Chicago. 

## Work

Currently I'm a Senior Solutions Engineer at [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com) working on building solutions and helping prospects reach value in Edge AI. Previously, I was at [PredictHQ](https://www.predicthq.com/) working as a Solutions Engineer after spending my first two years with PredictHQ as a Customer Experience Engineer. Before that, I was at [Losant](https://www.losant.com) as a customer success engineer. 

## Writing

[This site](https://github.com/hhheath/personal-site). I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them. 

[My Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@hheath_). I just want to _create_ more, simply for the sake of creating. 

## Reading

- The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

## What else?

I'm still actively spending time focused on my athletic endurance. I have big plans for 2025 in the way of races that I want to do and where I want to take my fitness. In the past 18 months, I've lost 90lbs, and am looking to lose another 50ish before my first race in April of 2025.
