## What I'm up to _right now_

Updated on **2024-09-15** from **Chicago, IL**

## Where 

Currently living in the Southwest Subrubs of Chicago. 

## Work

Currently I'm at [PredictHQ](https://www.predicthq.com/) working as a Solutions Engineer after spending my first two years with PredictHQ as a Customer Experience Engineer. I started here on April 18, 2022 after my time at [Losant](https://www.losant.com). I'm really looking forward to this new challenge, and I really believe I'll have a great impact here. 

## Writing

[This site](https://github.com/hhheath/personal-site). I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them. 

## Reading

- The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

## What else?

I'm still actively spending time working on my athletic endurance. I have big plans for 2025 in the way of races that I want to do and where I want to take my fitness. In the past 18 months, I've lost 90lbs, and am looking to lose another 50ish before my first race in April of 2025. 

I've also recently gotten the itch to write more code. So, I'm looking for a nice little project to work on to bring those skills of mine back to the top. I've also really been taken by peer to peer networks, filesharing, and communications.
