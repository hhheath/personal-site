## What I'm up to _right now_

Updated on **2022-11-05** from **Cincinnati, OH**

## Work

Currently I'm at [PredictHQ](https://www.predicthq.com/) working as a Customer Experience Engineer. I started here on April 18, 2022 after my time at [Losant](https://www.losant.com). I'm really looking forward to this new challenge, and I really believe I'll have a great impact here. 

## Writing

[This site](https://github.com/hhheath/pw4). I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them. 

## Reading

- [Einstein](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Einstein/Walter-Isaacson/9780743264747)
- [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)

## What else?

I'm still infatuated with cooking. I'm very lucky to live within walking distace to [Findlay Market](https://www.findlaymarket.org/) so my access to high quality, local produce and meat. I've really leveled up my cooking game recently. I am really working on trying to get the recipes I really like down to just 1 or 2 servings rather than 4-6 servings.

I have an urge to write more software. I really want to get good at this skill. So, keep an eye out for some content on that. I'll try to remember to link it here.
