## What I'm up to _right now_

Updated on **2023-02-27** from **Chicago, IL**

## Work

Currently I'm at [PredictHQ](https://www.predicthq.com/) working as a Customer Experience Engineer. I started here on April 18, 2022 after my time at [Losant](https://www.losant.com). I'm really looking forward to this new challenge, and I really believe I'll have a great impact here. 

## Writing

[This site](https://github.com/hhheath/pw4). I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them. 

## Reading

- [Hyperion Cantos #2 - The Fall of Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Hyperion_(novel)) (warning: spoilers in that link)

## What else?

I've recently moved to Chicago, IL where I'm living with my best friend for the foreseeable future.
