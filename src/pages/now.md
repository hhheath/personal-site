## What I'm up to _right now_

Updated on {{page.date}} from **Cincinnati, OH**

## Work

Currently I'm at [PredictHQ](https://www.predicthq.com/) working as a Customer Experience Engineer. I started here on April 18, 2022 after my time at [Losant](https://www.losant.com). I'm really looking forward to this new challenge, and I really believe I'll have a great impact here. 

## Writing

[This site](https://github.com/hhheath/pw4). I want to write more about the things that I read and take in. As well as get my opinions and thoughts about current events out there. I take a lot of notes and I read a lot of stuff every day, I want to write about them. 

## Reading

I'm in the middle of [Snow Crash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash). I'm also starting [The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1303.The_48_Laws_of_Power) and [How to Live](https://sive.rs/h). 

## What else?

I'm still infatuated with cooking. I'm very lucky to live within walking distace to [Findlay Market](https://www.findlaymarket.org/) so my access to high quality, local produce and meat. I've really leveled up my cooking game recently. 

I'm the secretary of [Hive13](https://www.hive13.org), a makerspace here in Cincinnati. I'm also the 3D Printing Warden. This means I take care of the area and make sure the machines are running in tip-top shape.
