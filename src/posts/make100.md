Let's make something for 100 days straight. 

## What 

There are a lot of times that I start something without a clear definition of what I'm doing. Let's do that here...

**What is Make100?**

Make100 is similar to #100DaysofCode or #100Daysof<insert-topic-here> (actually it's exactly like those), but with the focus on **generally making anything.** I want to commit, wholly, to creating _something_ every day for the next 100 days. 

> Code? Absolutely.
> Painting? Yep. 
> Food? Count it.
> 3D Printing? No doubt.
> Sweat? Work it.

Just **make** something. Once a day. For 100 days.

## Why 

Well... there are dozens of reasons why I want to do this, but, the main reason is that **I want to exercise my creative muscle.** Along with that, I want to commit to something. **Consistency** was my 2022 word of the year, and I want to stay true to that. 

I want to challenge myself to commit to something and to remain consistent throughout. I just want to make _things_; Software, small electronics projects, more 3D printing, maybe try spray paint art; the possibilities are endless. I just want to _create_. 

I also think that movements like #100DaysofCode might end up being too niche for some. Even though they would like to commit to doing _something_ for 100 days in a row, or want to participate in a community like that, #100DaysofCode might be too technical or too focused. 

This is for **all makers.**

## When

I started on May 1, 2022 (2022-05-01) with the revamp of this website, which you can learn more in [this post](/posts/hello/). Today, it's this blog post (and some delicious pasta I had for dinner). I'm not sure what it's going to be tomorrow, but that is a part of the excitement, right?

This means that my last day of make will be August 9, 2022 (2022-08-09).

## How

I'll [tweet](https://twitter.com/hhheath_) something every day with the hashtag #Make100 and a picture or a link. I'll probably set up a list on tweetdeck for the hashtag #Make100 so I can see, like, and retweet the things you make (there's probably a project idea here). 

I'd love to start a community around this as well. So, in that regard, I've made a discord server that you [can join](https://discord.gg/ZFqfTj6NVg) if you want to talk to Other Makers who are also participating in #Make100.
