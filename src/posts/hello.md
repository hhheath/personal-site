This is really just here to make sure that the site works.

I suppose I could also add some more information here. In the past, I've used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to write my personal site. NextJS worked great, but it all seemed so heavy (plugings, extra javascript, etc.) just to write & publish plain text blogs like I wanted to. 

So, with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), markdown is a first class citizen, the pages & folder structure are easily understood, and with the powerful templating I get do all the things I really want to do. 

From here on, I'm writing plain text.
