# My Personal Website

The 4th iteration of my personal site. I think this one will stick around for awhile. I wanted something _very_ simple and _very_ easy to update & maintain. 

Started from [Stephanie Eckles'](https://github.com/5t3ph) [smol eleventy starter](https://github.com/5t3ph/smol-11ty-starter)

This website is way more fun with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

What else should I add to this site? Add an issue to let me know! :)
